# sample-webapi-authcode-vb

This sample application uses VB.NET (this assumes Visual Studio 2012 and .NET 4.5, [go here for VS2010/.NET4.0](/tradestation/sample-webapi-authcode-vb/tree/dotNET4)) to authenticate with the TradeStation API via an OAuth 2 Authorizatin Code Grant Type. The user will be directed to TradeStation's login page to capture credentails. After a successful login, an auth code is return and is then exchanged for an access token which will be used for subsequent WebAPI calls.

    <applicationSettings>
